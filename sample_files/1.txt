Data: 
Kit is awesome. I play in my garage just for personal enjoyment not for performances or anything. Once you take the time to break down all the settings, your able to dial in pretty much any kit and sound. With the expansion options and the relatively inexpensive parts expanding is easy and fun.

After a few weeks of daily use for at least an hour a day it still looks and plays beautifully. Overall one of the best purchases I could have made.
