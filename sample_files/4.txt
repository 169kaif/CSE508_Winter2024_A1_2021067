Data: 
I'm using several of these on a wall I built. The hangers work great with several different head-stock shapes. I wish there were available bands, straps or locking devices to keep instruments secure here in earthquake prone California. I ended up using velcro strips under the hangers that affix over the fretboard. Otherwise a great hanger..
